a.
OLS Coefficients: [0.7752741]<br>
OLS Intercept: -0.08738446427005074 <br>
Standard Deviation of the OLS Error: 1.003756319417732<br>
Fitted MLE Ïƒ (Standard Deviation of the Error): 1.003756319417732<br>

mean_x1: 0.0010226951490000004<br>
mean_x2: 0.9902438191000001<br>
cov_xx: 1.0697746428027168<br>
cov_yy: 0.9614732933624849<br>
cov_xy: 0.530684554713422<br>
x2_conditional_mean = mean_x2 + cov_xy / cov_xx * (x1 - mean_x1)<br>
                    = 0.99 + 0.53/1.07 * (x1-0.001)<br>
x2_conditional_variance = 0.6982158881639965<br>

# Problem 3
Among all 6 AR and MA models, AR(3) is the best of fit with AIC equals to 1436.66 <br>
Within all MA models, MA(3) is the best of fit with AIC equals to 1536.87, which is slightly larger than the AIC of AR(3). <br>
